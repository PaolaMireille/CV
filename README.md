# CV
1.	Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
First of all, completing this assignment was not the easiest thing for me to do. I like the aftermath of creating a website although with the coding part it i'm still learning and am not great at yet. The aspects of the assignment that have been correctly implemented; i would say is the structure of the site for example the pages cv.html, bio.html, contact.html and index.html. I successfully managed to create the 4 html pages and a css document, of which i linked the two.
Each html page and document has a basic structure; in the code i used different tags and elements. For example, DIV tags, <p> and <li> lists. All these tags and elements helped me to structure my pages using, head, body header, container and footer tags. In my CSS document i did use over the minimum of 5 css rules. Another success is creating this README document. 
I did not use any inline styling all styling is in the CSS document

The general structure for each page was to have a header, navigation bar across the page and the main body area where the content will be held.

For the contact page i was to create a form, my idea of the form i was going to create consisted of 4 parts: Insert name, Insert email,  Insert phone number and insert a message. After the user has entered the information they will submit it and it will appear as a comment below. I managed to create input boxes for the form, but had a few difficulties with the submit button.
I included an image on the index page.

I created a navigation bar across the html pages of which appear on every page. This navigation bar is used to browse the different pages on the website. The buttons created are: Home as index.html, cv as cv.html, biography as bio.html and contact me as contact.html.

Something that has not, is creating an index page on github, i found difficulties creating it and i'm not sure if it has been done correctly. Also linking my CV and biograpghy to the index page. On the contact page i had trouble with creating the submit button for the form.

2.	Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
I haven't collaborated or discussed with anyone for this assignment.

3.	Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
I do not know the exact number of hours that i have spent on this assignment, though i would say i would have liked to spend more time on it so i could learn more styles to make my website look even better and more professional. By estimate I have spent approximately 5+ hours on this assignment.
